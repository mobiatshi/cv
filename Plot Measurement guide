In Revenue Record a marla for agricultural land is equivalent to 272 Square Feet and a kanal to 5440 Sq Ft or to 600 yards. A land is basically agricultural and is subsequently converted to residential or commercial.It is pertinent to mention here that in revenue record like Field Book, the land measurement is given in karams, 01 karam is equal to 5.5 feet. All the dimensions of a khasra (survey number) are in karams.

As per rules, regulations or bylaws in town planning the 272 sq ft marla is converted to a marla of 225 – 250 sq ft depending upon the strategy, requirement or practice in vogue in the area / locality. So a 01 kanal plot may vary from 4500 to 5440 sq ft or 500 to 600 yards. For example in Fazaia Housing Scheme, Tarnol one kanal plot is of 600 yards means of 5440 sq feet and of 10 marlas is equivalent to 300 yards or 2720 sq ft.

In housing schemes normally, sizes are 125 yards (05 marla), 250 yards (10 marla), 500 yards (01 kanal / 20 marla) and 1,000 yards (02 kanal). So when anyone is going to purchase land he must ask about the size and measurement of plot. Normally a yard multiplied by nine will give the sq feet size. For example 600 yards size would be equal to 5400 sq feet (600×9) and 500 yards size would be equal to 4500 sq ft (500×9). Accordingly the sq ft size would be for example 60’x90’=5400′ so when 5400′ is divided by 09 it would give 600.
